# üìÖ Project Summary ‚Äî 10.10.2025

## üîÑ Recent Changes


- **Added file**:  console_logs_10_10_2025 
- **Modified file**: main_sampling.py, parameter.py, training_all_model_one.py, validation.py




## üéØ Purpose of the Changes

‚û°Ô∏è Structuring the pipeline by relocating code to the proper modules: main, parameter, data, training, validation


‚úÖ Final outcome:


All parameters are initialized in a single place (parameter.py).

The main_sampling.py module passes them to all other modules (data_sampling, training, validation).

The pipeline is now modular, easily extendable, and fully configurable via PARAMS.



Actual flow of the pipeline 


main_sampling > parameter > data_sampling > training_all_models_one > validation 



## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code 


To execute code type :

# üìÖ Project Summary ‚Äî 02.10.2025

## üîÑ Recent Changes


- **Added file**:  main_sampling.py , data_sampling.py
- **Modified file**: training_all_model_one.py




## üéØ Purpose of the Changes

‚û°Ô∏è Implementation of negative sampling method (instead of the Cartesian product)




The code in new data module (data_sampling.py)  works as follows:

The input contains only positives (LINKED = 1).

The code generates negatives (LINKED = 0) automatically through negative sampling:

It takes supplier‚Äìbuyer pairs from the same NACE sections,

Randomly selects pairs that do not appear in the positive data,

Creates a set of negatives from them (so that positives and negatives are 50/50).

Next, it combines positives and negatives into combined_df.

Then, it applies a balancing strategy (if needed):

"oversample_negatives" ‚Üí duplicates the generated negatives to match the number of positives,

"undersample_positives" ‚Üí randomly trims the positives to match the number of negatives.

Using the new method, we have:

 LINKED
 
1    206736 (loaded from file) 

0    206736 (sampled) 

number of all rows combined  413472

üîë Key Observations

Accuracy

Old results: most models had accuracy ~0.92‚Äì0.95

New results: accuracy dropped to ~0.50‚Äì0.60

‚û°Ô∏è There is a huge drop in performance ‚Äì old models almost always predicted class 0 (high accuracy due to imbalanced data), while the new ones have to recognize a more balanced dataset.

Class 1 (minority) ‚Äì F1

Old results: F1 for class 1.0 ‚âà 0.0‚Äì0.16 (almost zero, classifiers ignored the minority class).

New results: F1 for class 1.0 increased to 0.47‚Äì0.65 (depending on the model).


‚û°Ô∏è The new models capture class 1 much better, even though overall accuracy has decreased.

Models particularly improved in the new results

MLP Classifier: previously ignored class 1, now F1(1.0) = 0.6577

Quadratic Discriminant Analysis: jump from ~0.005 to 0.654 F1 for class 1

Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM: F1(1.0) ‚âà 0.54‚Äì0.56 ‚Äì very stable

Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees: F1(1.0) ‚âà 0.47‚Äì0.48 (better than old results, which were 0.16)

Overall balance

Old trainings : models have artificially high accuracy, but completely useless for class 1

New trainings : models have lower accuracy (0.58‚Äì0.60), but meaningfully distinguish both classes

üìä Summary

Old results were a consequence of imbalanced data ‚Üí models almost always predicted class 0
.
New results show that models were trained/tested on a balanced dataset (50/50) or with a different metric ‚Üí accuracy dropped, but F1 for class 1 increased significantly.

Now the models are much more practically useful, as they can detect class 1.

# üìÖ Project Summary ‚Äî 12.09.2025

## üîÑ Recent Changes


- **Added file**:  main_linked.py , data_linked.py , training_model_1_linked.py 


## üéØ Purpose of the Changes


The goal of the updates is to: Simulates how the Portuguese VAT register would be processed in Data Module of pipeline

Assumming real portugal vat register will look as stated in document : Deliverable	11.0 ‚Äì Report describing the training and test sets, 
Annex 2  - Variables of Portuguese electronic invoices  E-Invoices (V_TF_EFAT_ENCRIPTADA_AAAA )


Assumming that you can load all register into dataframe and then  change name of columns in that dataframe

(some kind of mapping data structure e-invoices vs wp11_b2b_syntetic_data) :

'ANO': 'YYYY'

'NIF_EMITENTE': 'SUPPLIER'

'NIF_ADQUIRENTE_NAC_COL': 'BUYER'

after that you can add column LINKED with values set as 1 


In this code we use file "wp11_b2b_syntetic_data_linked_1_only_rows.parquet" 
This file contains only rows with real transactions taken from file "wp11_b2b_synthetic_data.parquet" all with linked=1. 

This is kind of simulation of loading real portugal VAT register as it will contains only real transaction wchich are classified as linked=1 by nature. 


With utilization of this code you can easly replace wp11_b2b_syntetic_data_linked_1_only_rows.parquet with real VAT register in data module when times comes



## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code 


To execute code type :

python main_linked.py

Note: This will train only one model, for demonstration purposes




---

### 1. Program start

* Displays a message that the data preparation module has started.

---

### 2. Loading company data

* Loads the file **`wp11_companies_synthetic_data.parquet`** into the DataFrame `df_companies`.
* Prints the first rows (`head`) and the total number of companies.

---

### 3. Loading transaction data (only existing ones)

* Loads the file **`wp11_b2b_syntetic_data_linked_1_only_rows.parquet`** into the DataFrame `df`.

  * This file contains only **real transactions** between companies, marked as `LINKED = 1`.
  * It simulates what the Portuguese VAT register would look like (each invoice = real transaction).
* Prints the number of rows.

---

### 4. Extracting unique companies

* Collects all unique company IDs from the **SUPPLIER** and **BUYER** columns.
* Creates a sorted list `unique_companies`.

---

### 5. Generating all possible company pairs

* Uses the **Cartesian product** (`itertools.product`) to generate all possible `SUPPLIER-BUYER` pairs.
* Stores the result in the DataFrame `all_pairs_df`.
* Prints the size of this DataFrame (the number of all possible relations).

---

### 6. Selecting existing pairs

* Extracts existing `SUPPLIER-BUYER` pairs from the transaction data (`df`).
* Stores them in `existing_pairs_df`.

---

### 7. Creating non-existing pairs (LINKED=0)

* Merges `all_pairs_df` with `existing_pairs_df` (left join).
* Pairs that **do not occur in the transaction data** are treated as **non-existent transactions**.
* Adds a column **LINKED=0** to those.
* The result is `zeros_df`.

---

### 8. Combining data

* Adds a **LINKED=1** column to the existing pairs (`existing_pairs_df`).
* Concatenates existing pairs (`LINKED=1`) and non-existing pairs (`LINKED=0`) into **combined\_df**.
* Resets the index.
* Now, `combined_df` contains all possible company pairs with labels:

  * `1` ‚Üí real transactions exist,
  * `0` ‚Üí transactions do not exist.

---

### 9. Final datasets is ready for training

* `b2b_df = combined_df` ‚Üí the full dataset of company relationships (ready for modeling).
* `business_df` = company data (`wp11_companies_synthetic_data.parquet`).

---

### 10. Summary

The whole code:

* Simulates how the Portuguese VAT register would be processed.
* From real transactions (`LINKED=1`) and the complete list of companies, it generates a **full matrix of possible inter-company relationships**.
* Creates binary labels (`LINKED=0/1`), which can be used to train ML models for predicting B2B links.

## üîÑ Recent Changes

- **Added file**: `training_all_models_hypertuning_gridsearch.py` 'main_hypertuning.py'
 
- **Added folder**: `tuning results`

## üéØ Purpose of the Changes

The goal of the updates is to: Hyperparameter Tuning

file `training_all_models_hypertuning_gridsearch.py`  contains additional function :


tune_all_models(X_train, y_train)

For most models, it defines a hyperparameter grid (param_grid).

For each model:

Runs GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to find the best parameters.

Saves the results to CSV files in the tuning_results directory.

Creates a summary of the best parameters (best_params_summary.csv).


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code 

To execute the training process (with hyperparameter tuning) :

python main_hypertuning.py


> **Note:** Hyperparameter tuning, once started could last very long time  (even 12 hours and more.)
>           Naive Bayes": GaussianNB() was excluded from hyperparameter tuning as it has no parameters for tuning.

- Eliminate **code redundancy** and simplify execution.
- Save training results to files, allowing trained models to be reused **without retraining** (via loading `.pkl` files).

> **Note:** Not all trained models were saved in the `models` folder, as some files exceeded GitHub's hard limit of **100 MB** for file uploads (`git push`).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What the Code Does

For each of the 12 models, the code:

- üìä **Generates new features** based on differences between companies  
  (e.g., turnover, fixed assets, wages).

# üìÖ Project Summary ‚Äî 30.04.2025

A search for the most appropriate model was conducted.

The training, testing, and evaluation process covered the following 12 models:

- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Naive Bayes  
- Decision Tree  
- Extra Trees  
- Logistic Regression  
- MLP Classifier  
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis  
- Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- LightGBM  
- AdaBoost  
- Random Forest

For each model, a supervised machine learning approach was implemented to classify the existence of network connections (denoted as **LINKED**) between pairs of companies based on relational features.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run a Specific Model

The `main.py` script is designed to evaluate various machine learning models. To run a specific model, follow these steps:

### 1. Select a Model

At the top of `main.py`, locate the list of available model imports. Uncomment the line corresponding to the model you wish to run. For example, to use **K-Nearest Neighbors**, uncomment:

```python
import training_model_1  # K-Nearest Neighbors
````

Make sure all other `training_model_X` imports remain commented out.

### 2. Enable the Model Execution

Scroll down to the training section in the `__main__` block. Uncomment the line that calls the selected model's `custom_train_model` function:

```python
y_test, y_pred = training_model_1.custom_train_model(b2b_merged)
```

Again, only one `training_model_X` function call should be active at a time.

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the script using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

* Load parameters and data
* Train the selected model
* Generate evaluation metrics
* Display and/or save the corresponding ROC/AUC plot
