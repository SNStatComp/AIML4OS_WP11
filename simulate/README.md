Create two simulated datasets that can be used for testing pipeline and transferability of the models.

- dataset A: where the model is trained upon
- dataset B: where the model is applied upon.


### Assumptions

- dataset A and dataset B are sampled using the same probability function, but the domain of the variables of country A and country B are different.

### Generated data

- A_enterprises.csv 
- A_locations.csv
- A_network.csv

- B_enterprises.csv
- B_locations.csv
- B_network.csv
